# Power of Image transformations on Visual Computing

## Project Overview
This project focused on exploring image processing, signal processing, and Fourier analysis techniques using Python and several powerful libraries. This project includes multiple labs designed to teach and demonstrate various computational techniques for manipulating images, signals, and frequency components.

The project utilizes libraries such as `OpenCV`, `Matplotlib`, `NumPy`, `SciPy`, and `scikit-image` to perform tasks including:

- Image manipulation (e.g., grayscale, binary, noise addition)
- Signal denoising (e.g., Gaussian, salt & pepper noise)
- Fourier Transform and Fourier Series analysis
- Convolution operations on images
- Image transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, shifting)

## Features

- **Lab 1**: Covers basic image manipulation and noise filtering.
- **Lab 2**: Implements advanced image denoising techniques and filter applications.
- **Lab 3**: Focuses on Fourier Transform and Fourier Series analysis for signal processing.
- **Lab 4**: Explores the impact of image transformations on the frequency domain.
